*  It means that the CPU has indicated that it is in the sleep mode and
*  its main clock can be removed. It is identical to Active from a peripheral
*  point of view. Any enabled interrupts can cause wakeup from the  Sleep mode.
*
* Parameters:
*  None

*  None

    ********************************************************************************

    * Summary:
    *  Puts the part into the Hibernate state. Only SRAM and UDBs are retained;
    *  most internal supplies are off. Wakeup is possible from a pin or a hibernate
    *  comparator only.
    *
    *  It is expected that the firmware has already frozen the IO-Cells using
    *  CySysPmFreezeIo() function before the call to this function. If this is
    *  omitted, the IO-cells will be frozen in the same way as they are
    *  in the Active to Deep Sleep transition, but will lose their state on wake up
    *  (because of the reset occurring at that time).
    *
    *  Because all the CPU state is lost, the CPU will start up at the reset vector.
    *  To save the firmware state through the Hibernate low power mode, a
    *  corresponding variable should be defined with CY_NOINIT attribute. It
    *  prevents data from being initialized to zero on startup. The interrupt
    *  cause of the hibernate peripheral is retained, such that it can be either
    *  read by the firmware or cause an interrupt after the firmware has booted and
    *  enabled the corresponding interrupt. To distinguish the wakeup from
    *  the Hibernate mode and the general Reset event, the CySysPmGetResetReason()
